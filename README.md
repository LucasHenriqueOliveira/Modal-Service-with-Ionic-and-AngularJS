This is an example the modal service using Ionic (with ngCordova) and AngularJS. This is a different example of [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/service/$ionicModal/) as it is a service and can pass data to the modal.

## How to use

*This template does not work on its own*. It is missing the Ionic library, and AngularJS.

To use this, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy and paste this into an existing Cordova project and download a release of Ionic separately.
